The project is in ideation phase. `DRAFT.md` is where I dump my thoughts.

The name kind of implies that it looks to be on par with SciPy. consig shares the vision that
Lean programs can be a better abstraction in scientific computing. However, SciLean project as
it is defined today jumps perhaps a bit rashly on the Lean train. The marketshare for
workshop-papers level signals simulation (the domain problem of consig) as of today, to our
knowledge, contrives Python, Matlab and Octave. In my opinion, we are yet to see signs that
there will be a shift in the landscape. Scientists and engineers have generally used what they
liked & works, and consig in philosophy doesn't want to change that.

Given enough time, hypothetically, Lean overtakes
Python as the most popular language for scientific computing, thanks to SciLean. consig's ideal
future is when reviewers sometimes ask authors of system simulation papers of proofs for
correctness of parts they are not convinced of.
