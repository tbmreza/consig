Consig empathizes very much with a project whose name suggests a rewrite of SciPy. We share the vision
that Lean programs can be a better abstraction in scientific computing. However, SciLean project as it is
defined today jumps perhaps a bit rashly on the Lean train. Workshop-paper level signals simulation (the
problem domain of Consig) practically revolves around Python, Matlab and Octave today. To our knowledge,
there has been no momentum strong enough in recent years for a shift in this landscape. Scientists and
engineers have generally used the tools they prefer, and Consig in philosophy doesn't want to change
that.

Given enough time, hypothetically, Lean overtakes Python as the most popular language for scientific
computing, thanks to SciLean. Consig's ideal future, on the other hand, is when reviewers sometimes ask
authors of simulation papers of proofs of parts they are not convinced of.
